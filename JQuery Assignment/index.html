                    &diams;     jQuery is not a programming language but a well written JavaScript code. It is a JavaScript code, which do document traversing, event handling, Ajax interactions
                    and Animations.

                <h3>[2] How to Apply CSS Using JQuery, How to Add Class and Remove Class in Jquery , JQuery Animation?
                    </h3>
                <p>
                <pre>
                    &diams;     selector.css( PropertyName, PropertyValue );When animating addClass() and removeClass() jQuery adds a temporary style to the element, and then 
                    increments the appropriate values until they reach the values of the provided class, and only then does it actually add/remove the class. 
 
                    &diams;     Because of this I have to remove the style attribute, otherwise if the animation is stopped halfway the style attribute would remain and would permanently 
                    overwrite any class values, since style attributes in a tag have higher importance than class styles. 
                     
                    &diams;     However when the animation is halfway done it hasn't yet added the new class, and so with this solution the color jumps to the previous color when the user moves 
                    their mouse before the animation is completed.
